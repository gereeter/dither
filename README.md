A program for reducing images to small palettes.

The primary innovation is the introduction of a new ordered dithering algorithm, called simplex dithering, that works with arbitrary palettes. Unlike many other such algorithms, it is provably "correct": as area increases, the average color of the resulting dithered image will converge to the average color of the original image.
